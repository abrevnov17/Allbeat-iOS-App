# Allbeat-iOS-App
This is an app that I am currently working on as the lead iOS developer for. The app has three other developers, and I handle the entirety of the front-end development, backend/frontend integration, and project management.

All of the programming I did for this app was in Swift.

This app is in the final development stages (still need to work out some minor bugs).
