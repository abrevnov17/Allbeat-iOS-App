# Allbeat-iOS-App
This is an app that I worked on as the lead iOS developer for in collaboration with three other iOS developers. I primarily handled front-end development, backend/frontend integration, and project management.

The app itself is a social-networking, music-discovery platform targeted at introducing users to Indie artists through 11 sec previews of their songs.

All of the programming I did for this app is in Swift.
